# Linked-List-Implementation
Linked list data structure implementation.

This is my first upload to github.

I created this project for an assignment in my CS class at the University of Florida.

The project features a fully complete Linked List data structure with around 30 class methods.
Some of these methods include printing the list backwards / forwards, inserting a node at a certain "index", 
and finding all the nodes that share the same data value. 

IMPORTANT:
Everything is complete inside the LinkedList.h file, test files are also included that were used to test 
whether or not certain functions worked.
